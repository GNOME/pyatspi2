D-Bus AT-SPI
------------

This version of at-spi is a major break from version 1.x.
It has been completely rewritten to use D-Bus rather than
ORBIT / CORBA for its transport protocol.

A page including instructions for testing, project status and
TODO items is kept up to date at:

The mailing list used for general questions is:
