What's new in pyatspi2 1.91.1:

    * Add configure check for python-xlib

    * Have calls on the async bus time out after 2 seconds

    * Added a LRU cache for objects that use the soft cache

What's new in pyatspi2 1.91.0:

* --disable-relocate is the default again.

* Added a "soft cache" to try to avoid repeatedly querying for information
in cases where we never received an AccessibleAdded signal for an object.

What's new in pyatspi2 0.3.91:

* Enable relocate by default for now.

* Ensure that queued events are delivered when calling registry.stop().

* If an unexpected exception is thrown when checking for the accessibility bus
(ie, python-xlib is missing), throw the exception rather than silently
reverting to the session bus.

What's new in pyatspi2 0.3.90:

* Have registerEventListener an deregisterEventListener notify the registry,
as is now needed.

* Avoid raising an event multiple times if EVENT_TREE is used to register for
all events.

What's new in pyatspi2 0.3.6:

* Some thread safety fixes; should no longer deadlock when listening for
events using Strongwind.

What's new in pyatspi2 0.3.4:

* Listen for AddAccessible and RemoveAccessible at the DesktopCache level.
This fixes a regression with Firefox for instance that was introduced in v0.3.3.

What's new in pyatspi2 0.3.3:

* Hyperlink fixes.

* When an object's parent is set to null, remove it from the parent in
the cache.

* Fix an issue where a state-changed handler can be called before the
cache received the signal and updated the state.

* Only range check for __getitem__, not getChildAtIndex.  This is
pyatspi-corba's behavior and should improve performance in some cases.

* Fix tracebacks when checking some event properties.

* Fix a traceback when simulating a defunct state for an object that has
gone away.

* Fix traceback when calling queryDocument.getAttributes(),
queryText().getCharacterExtents(), and queryValue().setCurrentValue().

* Fix handling of some ChildrenChanged signals sent by Firefox.

What's new in pyatspi2 0.3.2:

* Remove double deletion of application from the desktop cache handler.
Was causing a mostly harmless exception when an application shut down.

* Role changes now update the cache.

* Avoid throwing an exception in getState() if an object no longer exists.
This avoids potentially throwing an eception where at-spi-corba may not.

* Do not use the cache if registry.start() has not been called; allows
simple scripts without a main loop to work better.

What's new in pyatspi2 0.3.1.1:

Install to $PYTHONDIR again, since we have no arch-specific dependencies.

* Do not dispatch events while waiting for a reply from a method call.
What's new in pyatspi2 0.3.1:

* Fixed GetLink, GetColumnHeader, getAccessibleAtPoint, and possibly others.

* Fix children-changed, property-change::accessible-parent, and
active-descendant-changed events.

* Update an accessible's StateSet when a StateChanged signal is received.

* Properly fetch children of MANAGES_DESCENDANTS objects (ie, do not use cache)

* The desktop's role is now set to ROLE_DESKTOP_FRAME.

* Use pyexecdir as a base rather than pythondir.

* Disable relocation by default.
