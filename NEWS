What's new in pyatspi2 0.3.2:

* Remove double deletion of application from the desktop cache handler.
Was causing a mostly harmless exception when an application shut down.

* Role changes now update the cache.

* Avoid throwing an exception in getState() if an object no longer exists.
This avoids potentially throwing an eception where at-spi-corba may not.

* Do not use the cache if registry.start() has not been called; allows
simple scripts without a main loop to work better.

What's new in pyatspi2 0.3.1.1:

Install to $PYTHONDIR again, since we have no arch-specific dependencies.

* Do not dispatch events while waiting for a reply from a method call.
What's new in pyatspi2 0.3.1:

* Fixed GetLink, GetColumnHeader, getAccessibleAtPoint, and possibly others.

* Fix children-changed, property-change::accessible-parent, and
active-descendant-changed events.

* Update an accessible's StateSet when a StateChanged signal is received.

* Properly fetch children of MANAGES_DESCENDANTS objects (ie, do not use cache)

* The desktop's role is now set to ROLE_DESKTOP_FRAME.

* Use pyexecdir as a base rather than pythondir.

* Disable relocation by default.
