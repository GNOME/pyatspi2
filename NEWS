What's new in pyatspi2 0.3.1:

* Fixed GetLink, GetColumnHeader, getAccessibleAtPoint, and possibly others.

* Fix children-changed, property-change::accessible-parent, and
active-descendant-changed events.

* Update an accessible's StateSet when a StateChanged signal is received.

* Properly fetch children of MANAGES_DESCENDANTS objects (ie, do not use cache)

* The desktop's role is now set to ROLE_DESKTOP_FRAME.

* Use pyexecdir as a base rather than pythondir.

* Disable relocation by default.
